# QCViz Advisor Lookup Upgrade — Complete Deliverable

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**What changed:** The existing `functional_recommendations.json` has been upgraded with enriched metadata fields (applicability, avoid_when, cost_tier, evidence_strength, community_consensus, implementation_notes, basis_upgrade_path, validation_notes, last_reviewed, source_bucket) across all eight system types and all purpose keys. Rationale texts have been tightened with verified GMTKN55 WTMAD-2 numbers and new benchmark citations from 2023–2025. The alternatives arrays have been expanded with newly validated candidates (ωB97M-D3(BJ), ωB97X-V as future candidates; D4 dispersion as an upgrade path). Confidence scores have been recalibrated based on the SSE17 benchmark (Radoń et al. 2024, Chem. Sci.) and the radical benchmark (Reuben et al. 2024, Org. Biomol. Chem.).

**Default recommendations retained or changed:**

All eight system types retain their current default functionals (B3LYP-D3(BJ) for organic_small, organic_large, 3d_tm, radical, charged_organic, main_group_metal; PBE0-D3(BJ) for heavy_tm and lanthanide). No default functional was changed. This is the conservative, correct decision because:

1. B3LYP-D3(BJ) and PBE0-D3(BJ) remain the best-validated choices for their respective domains per Bursch et al. 2022 and Goerigk et al. 2017.
2. Superior alternatives (ωB97M-V, ωB97X-V) require VV10 non-local correlation, which is available in PySCF but not yet integrated into the QCViz runtime pipeline.
3. r2SCAN-3c requires gCP + D4 + custom basis set, which is an open feature request in PySCF (issue #825, #2569) and not production-ready in our stack.

**Top 3 risks:**

1. **3d TM spin-state confidence over-estimation:** The SSE17 benchmark (Radoń et al. 2024) shows B3LYP-D3(BJ) and TPSSh-D3(BJ) have MAEs of 5–7 kcal/mol for spin-state energetics, significantly worse than double-hybrids. Confidence for 3d_tm single_point has been lowered from 0.70 to 0.62.
2. **r2SCAN-3c listed as alternative but not implementable:** It remains in alternatives, but the JSON now explicitly notes it requires code-side composite method support that PySCF/QCViz lacks.
3. **Radical functional alternatives:** ωB97M-V and M06-2X-D3(0) outperform UB3LYP for radical properties, but neither is currently wired into the QCViz xc_map. They are placed in alternatives with implementation notes.

## 2. Research Log

**Investigation execution date:** 2026-03-30

**Investigation target period:** Publications and benchmarks from 2017 through early 2025 (with primary focus on 2022–2025 for "latest" assessment)

**Search strategy:**

- Google Scholar / Web search for benchmark papers by keyword: "DFT functional benchmark", "GMTKN55 WTMAD-2", "transition metal spin state DFT", "radical DFT benchmark", "lanthanide DFT", "r2SCAN-3c benchmark", "ωB97M-V benchmark"
- Direct crawling of Grimme lab GMTKN55 WTMAD-2 tables (uni-bonn.de)
- PySCF GitHub issues (#825, #983, #1413, #2569, #2666) for functional support status
- Rowan benchmarks for r2SCAN-3c performance data
- RSC, ACS, Wiley, ChemRxiv for full-text access to key papers

**Source inclusion criteria:** Peer-reviewed journal articles (primary), preprints on ChemRxiv that have subsequently been published (secondary), official software documentation and GitHub issues (tertiary), community discussions only for practical convergence/failure mode notes.

**Source exclusion criteria:** Reddit/ResearchGate comments not backed by published data; blog posts without citations; papers focused exclusively on periodic/solid-state DFT; papers older than 2015 unless foundational (e.g., Weigend & Ahlrichs 2005).

## 5. Delta Report

### Changed Defaults

**None.** All eight system types retain their original default functional/basis/dispersion combinations. This was a deliberate conservative decision based on the following assessment:

The original defaults (B3LYP-D3(BJ) for organic/radical/main-group, PBE0-D3(BJ) for heavy_tm/lanthanide) remain the best-validated choices that are simultaneously (a) strongly supported by peer-reviewed benchmarks, (b) fully supported in PySCF, and (c) wired into the existing QCViz xc_map. While ωB97X-V and ωB97M-D3(BJ) show superior GMTKN55 performance, they cannot safely be made defaults without xc_map updates.

### Changed Basis Recommendations

**None.** All basis set recommendations retained. The def2-SVP/def2-TZVP two-step protocol remains the consensus best practice per Bursch et al. 2022.

### Changed Confidence Scores

| System Type | Purpose      | Old  | New  | Reason                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3d_tm       | single_point | 0.70 | 0.62 | SSE17 (Radoń 2024) demonstrates MAE of 5–7 kcal/mol for spin-state energetics with B3LYP, worse than previously assumed |
| radical     | default      | 0.78 | 0.75 | Reuben et al. 2024 shows B3LYP is not best-in-class for radicals; M06-2X outperforms                                    |

All other confidence values retained.

### Added Alternatives

| System Type     | New Alternative           | Rationale                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| organic_small   | ωB97X-V / def2-TZVP       | WTMAD-2 = 3.98, best hybrid on GMTKN55. Future candidate.                          |
| organic_small   | ωB97M-D3(BJ) / def2-TZVP  | Wiggle150 top performer. Avoids NLC. Future candidate.                             |
| 3d_tm           | PWPB95-D3(BJ) / def2-TZVP | SSE17 best DFT for spin states (MAE <3 kcal/mol). Double-hybrid, future candidate. |
| radical         | UM06-2X-D3(0) / def2-TZVP | Reuben et al. 2024 best performer for RSE, BDE, redox.                             |
| radical         | ωB97M-D3(BJ) / def2-TZVP  | Strong RSE/BDE performance.                                                        |
| charged_organic | ωB97X-V / def2-TZVP       | WTMAD-2 = 3.98. Range-separated: critical for SIE in charged species.              |

### Added Metadata Fields (all entries)

Every rule entry now includes: `applicability`, `avoid_when`, `cost_tier`, `evidence_strength`, `community_consensus`, `implementation_notes`, `basis_upgrade_path`, `validation_notes`, `last_reviewed`, `source_bucket`. These are backward-compatible additions—existing code consuming only the original fields will ignore these.

### Added Warnings/Notes

The `avoid_when` field is new and provides explicit guidance on when NOT to use a recommendation. Key warnings added include spin-state limitations of B3LYP for 3d TM, multireference caution for lanthanides, spin contamination thresholds for radicals, and self-interaction error caveats for charged species.

### Updated Rationale Text

All rationale strings have been refined to include specific GMTKN55 WTMAD-2 numbers verified against the official Grimme lab table, specific MAE values from recent benchmarks (SSE17, Reuben et al.), and specific basis-set convergence notes.

### Updated References

New DOIs added: 10.1039/D4SC05471G (SSE17), 10.1039/D4OB00532E (radical benchmark), 10.1021/acs.jctc.5b01193 (Ln54), 10.1021/acs.jctc.6b01223 (Ln54 ECP), 10.1039/D3DT03221C (Ln DFT perspective), 10.1021/acs.jctc.5c00015 (Wiggle150).

### Version Bump

`_metadata.version`: 1.1.0 → 2.0.0. `_metadata.last_modified`: 2026-03-08 → 2026-03-30. `_metadata.sources` expanded to include Radoń et al. 2024 and Reuben et al. 2024.

## 6. Compatibility / Gap Report

### Current Code Compatibility

**The proposed JSON is fully backward-compatible.** No field was removed or renamed. No key was deleted. All new information is in additive fields that existing consumers will ignore.

### dft_accuracy_table.json Impact

**Status: No immediate changes required.**

The proposed JSON does not change any default functional. All default functionals (B3LYP, PBE0, UB3LYP) are already in the accuracy table. However, the following new alternatives are NOT currently in `dft_accuracy_table.json` and would need entries if they are ever promoted to defaults:

| Functional    | Currently in dft_accuracy_table? | Action Needed              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| ωB97X-V       | Unknown (likely NO)              | Add if promoted to default |
| ωB97M-D3(BJ)  | Unknown (likely NO)              | Add if promoted to default |
| UM06-2X-D3(0) | Unknown (likely NO)              | Add if promoted to default |
| PWPB95-D3(BJ) | Unknown (likely NO)              | Add if promoted to default |

**Verdict:** No mandatory change now. These are flagged as "필수 후속 변경 (when alternatives are promoted)."

### preset_recommender.py xc_map Impact

**Status: No immediate changes required.**

All default functionals are already in xc_map. The following new alternatives would need xc_map entries for full pipeline integration:

| Functional | In xc_map? | PySCF xc string | D

| ispersion     | Action    |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ωB97X-V       | Likely NO | `'HYP_GGA_XC_WB97X_V'` or `'wb97x_v'` | NLC (VV10) | Add to xc_map + NLC handler                  |
| ωB97M-D3(BJ)  | Likely NO | `'wb97m_v'` base + D3BJ override      | d3bj       | Add to xc_map + D3BJ params                  |
| UM06-2X-D3(0) | Likely NO | `'M062X'`                             | d3zero     | Add to xc_map + D3(0) params                 |
| PWPB95-D3(BJ) | Likely NO | custom definition via libxc           | d3bj       | Add to xc_map (double-hybrid handler needed) |

**Verdict:** No mandatory change now. These are "future candidate" alternatives and are explicitly marked as `future_candidate: true` in the JSON. The xc_map entries should be added as part of a separate code sprint before any of these can be promoted.

### Can This Be Dropped In Without Code Changes?

**YES.** The proposed JSON can be placed directly into `src/qcviz_mcp/advisor/reference_data/functional_recommendations.json` and will work without any code modification. The existing consumers read only the fields they know about; the new metadata fields are ignored by the current runtime. The preset recommender will continue to look up `functional`, `basis`, `dispersion`, and `confidence` exactly as before.

### Items That Would Be Dangerous to Drop In

**None for the JSON itself.** However, caution is needed regarding:

1. **Do NOT manually add the new alternative functionals to xc_map without testing.** The JSON simply lists them as alternatives with `future_candidate: true`. If someone reads the JSON alternatives and tries to run ωB97M-D3(BJ) through the current pipeline without an xc_map entry, it will fail at the PySCF xc string resolution step.

2. **The `pyscf_supported` field in alternatives is informational only.** The runtime does not currently read this field. If a future code change starts consuming it to auto-filter alternatives, the boolean values must be verified against the actual PySCF version deployed.

## Appendix: Future Upgrade Roadmap (for product team reference)

The following items are not part of the current JSON drop-in but represent high-value improvements that require coordinated code and data changes:

**Priority 1 — xc_map expansion (estimated effort: small)**

Add M06-2X-D3(0) and ωB97M-D3(BJ) to `preset_recommender.py` xc_map. Both are available via PySCF libxc and do not require NLC integration. Once added, the radical category default could be conditionally upgraded to M06-2X-D3(0) based on the strong evidence from Reuben et al. 2024.

**Priority 2 — NLC integration (estimated effort: medium)**

Enable VV10 non-local correlation in the QCViz calculation pipeline. This would unlock ωB97X-V (GMTKN55 WTMAD-2 = 3.98) and ωB97M-V as potential defaults, representing a significant accuracy improvement across all organic categories.

**Priority 3 — Composite method support (estimated effort: large)**

Implement r2SCAN-3c as a composite workflow (r2SCAN + D4 + gCP + mTZVPP basis). This would provide a major cost-accuracy improvement for organic_large and screening applications. Depends on PySCF upstream support (issues #825, #2569).

**Priority 4 — New system type: excited_state**

TD-DFT recommendations for UV-Vis spectroscopy. Would require a new top-level key and cannot be added until the advisor code can generate TD-DFT workflows. CAM-B3LYP, PBE0, and ωB97X-D are the leading candidates for this category.

**Priority 5 — New system type: periodic / solid_state**

Not applicable to the current molecular QCViz scope but worth tracking for future expansion with PySCF PBC module.
